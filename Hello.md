# Hello - Lionel Richie

I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I kissed your lips a thousend times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your yes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometime I feel my heart will overflow

Hello
I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello
Is it me you're looking for
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you
